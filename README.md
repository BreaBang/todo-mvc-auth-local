# Introduction

This simple Project Managment App is built using the MVC Architecture, we have also implemented "authorization" so users can sign up and log into the app. 

# Objectives

- It's a beginner level app created to understand how MVC concept and logins are added

- This project also provided exposure to using EJS and Node.js.

- This was a group project that required 100devs developers to work together to understand the code and get it to run the way we wanted to.  

# Packages/Dependencies used 

npm i bcrypt, connect-mongo, dotenv, ejs, express, express-flash, express-session, mongodb, mongoose, morgan, nodemon, passport, passport-local, validator


# Things to add

- Create a `.env` file and add the following as `key: value` 
  - PORT: 2121 (can be any port example: 3000) 
  - DB_STRING: `your database URI`

# Lessons Learned

One thing I leanred fromt his project was how to add and render items from the controller into the EJS file. 

# If We Had More Time

1) One thing would be to add some logic to the percentage calculation so that 0 and 100% were the min and max values.
